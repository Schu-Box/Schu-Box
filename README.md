Hello! My name is Schu and I'm passionate about expanding the genre of sports games by exploring mechanics that go beyond replicating real-life sports. I'm highly interested in simulations and the evolution of sports over time.
I'm currently developing a soccer-themed roguelike deckbuilder.

For potential employers or collaborators:
* Gridiron Legacy is a good example of my latest code style for a project in prototyping stage.
* Flinger Tactics is a good example of one of my fully shipped games.
