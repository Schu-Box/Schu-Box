Hello! My name is Schu and I'm passionate about expanding the genre of sports games by exploring mechanics that go beyond replicating real-life sports. I'm highly interested in simulations and the evolution of sports over time.
I'm currently developing a turn-based strategy sports game called Dicey Birdball. The game jam version is linked below.

For potential employers or collaborators:
* Flinger Tactics is my most recent non-jam game and is fully open source, available on Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1157050/Flinger_Tactics/
* GMTK Jam 2022 shows what I can do in 48 hours and how comfortable I am with Unity/C#, playable in browser at https://schubox.itch.io/dicey-football
